# Hangman-game-basic
Welcome to the Hangman Game, a fun and interactive Python project that brings the classic word-guessing game to life! 🧑‍💻🎮

Features:
Random Word Selection: Each round, the game randomly selects a word from a list for you to guess.
Visual Feedback: A visually engaging display shows the game's current status, including the number of lives remaining and the partially guessed word.
Tracking Guesses: The game tracks your correct and incorrect guesses, letting you know if you've guessed a letter before.
Engaging Stages: With each incorrect guess, you’ll see the progression of the iconic hangman drawing (thanks to the Hangman Art) as you lose lives.
Win or Lose: The game ends when you've either guessed the word correctly or run out of lives.

How to Play:
Run the Python script.
Guess a letter to try and figure out the word.
If the letter is in the word, it’s revealed in its correct position.
If the letter is incorrect, you lose a life.
The game continues until you either guess the word or run out of lives.

Technology Used:
Python
Random module
Custom Word List and Art from external files (hangman_words.py and hangman_art.py)
